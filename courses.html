                    <p>My name is Dr. Marike Herold-Dublin. I’ve been teaching German as a foreign language professionally for five years. I’m trained and certified by the Goethe-Institute and teach according to their communicative approach method. I attended university and worked in the US for over ten years, so I understand the challenges of learning a language and trying to thrive in a foreign country. Through my personal experiences, I developed several successful strategies that I'll pass on to you.</p>
