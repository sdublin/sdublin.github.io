                        <p>Why do people want to learn German? The reasons vary from person to person, but most often it’s about wanting to feel more confident in daily life situations. That’s why I design classes focused on real life situations you’ll experience while living in Germany.</p>

                        <h2>Everyday German</h2>
                        <p>This course focuses on daily conversation. The perfect “German for Beginners” course. If you live in Germany, you might speak English at work. However, being able to speak and understand German will get you closer to the local culture. Learn how to chat with your neighbors and develop your vocabulary so you can watch German TV and and read newspapers.
                           Maybe you have German relatives or friends you like to talk to. Everyday German gives you the skills you need to share your thoughts and opinions confidently.

                        <h2>At Work</h2>
                        <p>Do you work for a German company? Trying to start a business in Germany? This course gives you the vocabulary you need. Even if your company’s official language is English, it’s appreciated when you make an effort to speak the local language. Impress coworkers with your new German skills! I worked in the pharmaceutical industry and understand corporate life from the inside. Using this knowledge I’ve assembled a course focusing on typical situations at work, such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Greeting clients and coworkers</li>
                                <li>Understanding and participating in meetings</li>
                                <li>Following and giving instructions</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>Did you know that grammar is especially important at work? I’ll cover the grammar you need to know.
                            <ul>
                                <li>How do I give orders and advice in a polite way?</li>
                                <li>How do I give reasons and explanations?</li>
                                <li>How can I express an opposing opinion?</li>
                            </ul

                    <h2>For Moms and Dads</h2>
                        <p>Is your family moving to Germany and you’ll have to manage the household? Soon you’ll find yourself speaking to German pediatricians and trying to understand the rules of the German school system. As a mother of two kids, I put together this course that focuses on the kind of conversations a parent encounters at Kindergarten or school, on the playground or at the pediatrician.</p>

                    <h2>Moving to Germany</h2>
                        <p>Are you moving to Germany? Maybe you have a relocation service helping you find an apartment and get a visa. But after that, you’re on your own. What do these traffic signs mean, why are there four trash cans in front of my house and what does this letter from the German government mean? This course focuses on the practical aspects of living in Germany. It picks up where your relocation service ends and helps you navigate daily German life so you’ll integrate successfully.</p>

                    <h2>German for Travel</h2>
                        <p>If you want to get the most from your vacation in Germany, knowing the language goes a long way, especially when you explore outside the major cities. This course focuses on situations a tourist frequently encounters.
                        <ul>
                            <li>How do I book a room or buy train tickets?</li>
                            <li>How do I ask for directions and understand them as well!</li>
